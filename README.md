# SomeWhat Engine

A partially completed sales engine for use in a Turing exercise.

## Objectives

Let's look at adding 2 new business logic features:

* `Customer#favorite_items(n)` -- this method should return the
  specified number of a customer's "favorite" items, meaning the items
  which they have purchased the most, by quantity
* `Item#purchased_with` -- this method should return a collection of all
  the other items that the given item was purchased with in the same
  order.
